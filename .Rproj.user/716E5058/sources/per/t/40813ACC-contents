# Introduction

This project explores patterns in **flight delays, cancellations, and performance** across U.S. airports and airlines. Using SQL on the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) on-time data set, I extracted insights about:

-   Which airports and days are the busiest
-   Which locations experience the greatest delays
-   How cancellations vary by cause
-   How flight volume changes over time

The goal is to transform raw flight records into a **clear, data-driven story** about the U.S. air transportation system.

# 1. Understanding the Data

The dataset contains detailed records on domestic U.S. flights, including departure and arrival times, delays, cancellations, cancellation causes, airline codes, and airport information.

```{r}
al_perf <- read_csv("data/al_perf.csv")
dim_airlines <- read_csv("data/L_AIRLINE_ID.csv")
dim_airports <- read_csv("data/L_AIRPORT.csv")
dim_airport_id <- read_csv("data/L_AIRPORT_ID.csv")
dim_distance <- read_csv("data/L_DISTANCE_GROUP_250.csv")
dim_cancel <- read_csv("data/L_CANCELATION.csv")
dim_weekdays <- read_csv("data/L_WEEKDAYS.csv")
